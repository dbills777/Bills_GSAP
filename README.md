# BootStrap CSS

You are to demonstrate that you know how to use basic HTML and CSS by building a responsive single page marketing webpage for one of these three companies:

_Road Warriors_ - Bike shop (Chose for this assignment) 
# Click Here [Link to My Project](https://bills2780bikes.netlify.com/)
# The URL you used for layout is: [Rivian](https://rivian.com)



_Cozy Corner_ - Book store 



_Calm Mind_ - Spa 


You will use one of these companies as a guide for your content.  For design, you will need to find a website that you admire as a guide for layout.  You will then combine the company content and the layout of the website you admire to create a single page marketing site.

## Project Resources

Images and content can be frustrating to find and use in any project.  To alleviate your time on design, consider using these resources so you can focus on the code:

- For copyright free images, you can use [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)

- For filler text use a [lorem ipsum generator](https://www.lipsum.com/)
